COMP9417 - Machine Learning
Homework 2: Newton’s Method and Mean Squared Error of
Estimators
Introduction In homework 1, we considered Gradient Descent (and coordinate descent) for minimizing a
regularized loss function. In this homework, we consider an alternative method known as Newton’s algorithm.
We will first run Newton’s algorithm on a simple toy problem, and then implement it from scratch
on a real life classification problem. We will also dig deeper into the idea of estimation and comparing
estimators based on bias, variance and MSE.
Points Allocation There are a total of 28 marks.
